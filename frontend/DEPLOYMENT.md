## Deployment Instructions for Vercel

This project is now configured for deployment on Vercel with proper SPA routing support.

### What was fixed:

1. **Root Route**: Added a redirect from `/` to `/dashboard` to handle the root path
2. **SPA Routing**: Created `vercel.json` to handle client-side routing properly
3. **Build Configuration**: Updated Vite config for optimal production builds
4. **Deployment Ready**: All routing issues resolved

### Deployment Steps:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect this as a Vite project
4. The `vercel.json` configuration will handle SPA routing
5. Deploy!

### Routes:
- `/` → Redirects to `/dashboard`
- `/dashboard` → Main dashboard page
- Any other route → 404 page

The project is now ready for deployment on Vercel without routing errors!
